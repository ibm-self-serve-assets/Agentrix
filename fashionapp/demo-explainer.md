Fashion App - Closet Companion with watsonx.ai & Agentic AI
		Once the application is opened, you can login to view 3 personas- Jennie, Logan and Regina. These users are existing users with their profile details saved in the application.
		There is an option to create a new user if required for the duration of the session
		On selecting either of the personas, you would be taken to the homepage that displays upcoming events along with details such as Event name, location and date
		You may choose to add a new custom event from the right hand button- “Add Event”
		On your left, you would see the persona’s profile details for additional context. At the bottom, the items already present in the user’s wardrobe are displayed
		On clicking the “AI” icon in the event tiles, you can get styling recommendations and travel recommendations for a given event
		On the top right-hand corner you can “logout” to go back to the page to select another persona which follows a similar flow as described above.
