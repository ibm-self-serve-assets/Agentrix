  The Personal Styling Assistant is an AI-powered wardrobe planner that helps users curate and organize their clothing with ease.
  By analyzing user preferences and available wardrobe items, the agent suggests ideal outfit combinations for different
  occasions—whether casual, professional, or formal. Users can plan ahead, receive personalized style advice, and discover new
  pairings they may not have considered. This streamlines decision-making and reduces the daily effort of getting dressed, while 
  encouraging creativity and confidence in personal style.
