title_name: Explore industry-specific agents
short_description: Industry-specific agents built with LangGraph and watsonx.ai LLMs showcase how agentic systems outperform standalone prompts.
long_description: |
A set of Industry-specific agents are preconfigured using a specific Agent Framework and watsonx.ai LLMs to demonstrate how an Agentic system can be built to answer user questions
 more accurately and comprehensively compared to simply prompt engineering a standalone LLM. The example domain specific Agents help the user with travel planning, financial analysis and 
 literature research. Each Agent uses the LangGraph framework and a watsonx.ai LLM along with external tools. It combines reasoning and tool calling capabilities of the underlying LLM to 
 create an iterative flow that performs better compared to the LLM's answer based on a single prompt.

workflow: " Select one of the industry use cases.You will see a preselected agent configuration. For e.g. the travel planning agent uses the following presets. Framework: LangGraph framework . Tools: WikipediaTool, DuckDuckGoTool, WebCrawlerTool, OpenMeteoToolMemory: Token Memory (Click on info icon to view what it means)LLM: meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct.Prompt: The same prompt is also directly sent to an LLM for comparison with the Agent response.Click on "Submit" to receive the agentic response. An LLM response is also generated for comparison.In addition, also check the Agent's reasoning + action (ReACT) template with Thought, Action and Observation loop that is created by the LLM to solve the problem"
