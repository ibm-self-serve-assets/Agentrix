# 🧠 Supply Chain Automation Agent: AI-Powered Operations Planning & Execution

Welcome to the **Supply Chain Automation Agent**, a smart agentic AI system that simulates a real-world operations team—automating demand forecasting, inventory evaluation, vendor procurement, logistics planning, and compliance—all in one conversation.

This demo showcases how autonomous agents can collectively manage an entire supply chain lifecycle using natural language prompts and decentralized decision-making.

## How It Works

### 1. Ask a Business Question

Begin by asking a high-level question related to your supply chain operations. For example:

> "Forecast demand for SKU001 for the next 4 weeks."
> "We need to restock SKU001 and choose the best vendor."
> "Verify compliance of Supplier A with ESG norms.

This single prompt activates a chain of specialized agents, each responsible for a specific function in the supply chain.

### 2. Behind the Scenes: Agents at Work

As soon as your query is submitted, the following agent workflow is triggered:

- 📦 **Forecast Agent** analyzes historical trends to predict upcoming demand
- 📊 **Inventory Agent** checks current stock availability and capacity
- 🤝 **Procurement Agent** identifies optimal vendors and purchase orders
- 🚚 **Logistics Agent** plans delivery timelines and shipment strategy
- 📋 **Compliance Agent** validates supplier eligibility and policy conformance
- 🧠 **Controller Agent** orchestrates decisions and combines all results into a coherent response

Each agent performs its task independently, shares reasoning, and collaborates in real-time—just like a virtual supply chain team.

### 3. Review Your Intelligent Plan

Once complete, you'll receive a detailed breakdown with:

- ✅ Forecasted demand data
- ✅ Inventory availability and risks
- ✅ Recommended suppliers and PO breakdowns
- ✅ Planned delivery dates and routes
- ✅ Compliance status and alerts
- ✅ Full reasoning trail for every decision made

These results are displayed in a chat UI, with expandable sections for reasoning and summary tables.
