tile_name: Supply Chain Automation Agent
short_description: Autonomous multi-agent system for orchestrating supply chain operations using watsonx Orchestrate.
long_description: |
  The Supply Chain Automation Agent is a modular AI system built on IBM watsonx Orchestrate.
  It simulates real-world enterprise supply chain workflows—ranging from demand forecasting 
  and inventory planning to procurement, logistics, and compliance—by coordinating multiple 
  specialized agents. Each agent leverages domain-specific tools and Granite LLMs to make 
  intelligent, step-wise decisions. A controller agent orchestrates task delegation and 
  response synthesis to streamline end-to-end supply chain operations.
