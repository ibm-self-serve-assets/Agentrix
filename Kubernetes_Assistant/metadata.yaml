long_description: |
 Managing Kubernetes and Openshift environments could be a daunting task and requires deep skills in container technology.
Leveraging Generative AI capabilities can significantly help SREs to quickly understand the issue and possible resolution; 
while can significantly boost productivity of DevOps engineers by Kubernetes Code explanation, generation and review .
This demo showcases how watsonx.ai augments to SRE & DevOps engineers' capabilities to handle day-to-day Kubernetes tasks.

example_prompts: 
  - Ask a Question:
    - How can I run a security scan for pod before it is provisioned?
    - How can I run a security scan for pod before it is provisioned? Can I use admission controller for this purpose?
    - What is NetworkPolicy?
  - Generate K8s Code:
    - Write code to allow traffic from only 'demo' namespace into the pods on port 4444 with label 'env=prod' ?
    - Write Kubernetes yaml files to deploy application from the image quay.io/ecotz/sampleapp:1.0 and expose this as a ClusterIP service
  - Explain Code & Review Code:

workflow: "### Planned Major Functionalities\n1. **Cluster Connectivity**\n   * Users will upload a **kubeconfig file** to connect to their Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.\n   * Only **read-only access** will be required.\n2. **Namespace & Resource Selection**\n   * Users will select a **namespace** to list **unhealthy pods** or choose a **deployment/statefulset** to initiate a **security scan**.\n3. **Diagnosis with watsonx**\n   * On selecting an **unhealthy pod**, the agent will generate a **summary and recommended resolution** using watsonx.\n4. **Security Vulnerability Scanning**\n   * Users will scan selected **deployments/statefulsets** for vulnerabilities and receive **AI-generated recommendations**.\n5. **Ask a Kubernetes Question**\n   * An AI assistant will help users understand specific resolution steps or Kubernetes concepts as needed.\n6. **Peer Review Kubernetes Code**\n   * If issues relate to pod definitions, the agent will provide a **peer review** of the Kubernetes code for the owning resource (e.g., Deployment, StatefulSet).\n7. **Explain Kubernetes Code**\n   * Users will receive **detailed explanations** of any selected Kubernetes YAML definitions.\n8. **Kubernetes Code Generation**\n   * The agent will allow generation of YAML manifests for resources like **ConfigMaps**, **Secrets**, and **Deployments**.\n---\n### Planned Tech Stack\n* **AI Engine**: watsonx.ai\n* **Supported Platforms**: Kubernetes and OpenShift\n* **Cluster Access**: kubeconfig with **read-only permissions**\n---\n### Proposed Flow\n1. **Connect to Cluster**\n   → Upload kubeconfig → Establish read-only connection\n2. **Select Namespace or Resource**\n   → Choose namespace → List unhealthy pods\n   → Or select deployment/statefulset → Initiate scan\n3. **Run AI-Driven Tasks**\n   → Diagnose unhealthy pods\n   → Scan for vulnerabilities\n4. **Interact & Act with AI**\n   → Ask questions about resolutions\n   → Peer review resource definitions\n   → Explain YAML configurations\n   → Generate new Kubernetes manifests"
