- 1.3 Enter a name and description for your API key
- 1.4 Click **Create**
- 1.5 Then, click **Show** to display the API key. Or, click **Copy** to copy and save it for later, or click **Download**

##### Steps to create project_id (skip 2.1 to 2.3 for watsonx trial account)

- 2.1 In IBM Cloud, [Set up IBM Cloud Object Storage for use with IBM watsonx](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.co5.2/docs/content/wsj/console/wdp_admin_cos.html?context=wx&audience=wdp)

    ```

4. Finally run the backend application with the following command:

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

5. The app will start running on localhost port 8000.

> Note: Keep this terminal open for the frontend to work with backend.

## Steps to Run the Frontend Application Locally

1. In another terminal, navigate to `frontend` directory from the root directory and create another `.env` file. You can refer to the `example.env` file for your reference.
    
    ```bash
    cp example.env .env

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Finally run the frontend application with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. The app will start running on localhost port 3000.
   
7. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.
