title_name: Maximo Planner Agent
short_description: AI-powered orchestration system that automates Maximo work order management using IBM watsonx Orchestrate. It coordinates weather, inventory, and labor agents to handle key decision-making for maintenance operations.
long_description: |
  The Maximo Supervisory Agent is an intelligent orchestration system built using IBM watsonx Orchestrate.
  It automates key components of Maximo enterprise asset management, including weather assessments for field tasks,
  real-time inventory availability checks, and labor scheduling. A Supervisory Agent acts as the central controller,
  routing natural language queries to the appropriate sub-agents and synthesizing results for end-to-end work order optimization.
  The system is deployed with a FastAPI backend and supports an optional React-based frontend for streamlined interaction.

  # Maximo Supervisory Agent

  This application simulates AI-powered decision-making in **Maximo** by integrating **Maximo REST APIs** with a multi-agent architecture powered by the **bee-ai framework**. The central **Supervisory Agent**, built using **bee-ai + ACP server**, interprets user prompts and routes them through a sequential agentic workflow:

  **Flow:**  
  **Weather Agent → Inventory Agent → Labor Agent**

  Each specialized agent is developed using the **bee-ai framework**, while the supervisory logic is orchestrated using the **bee-ai + ACP server**. This setup enables intelligent, step-by-step decision-making for planning and scheduling Maximo work orders based on environmental, inventory, and labor conditions.

  
  ## Key Agents

  - **Weather Agent** – Determines environmental readiness for field work using Open-Meteo and wttr.in APIs.
  - **Inventory Agent** – Queries Maximo inventory availability for a given work order.
  - **Labor Agent** – Assigns or verifies technicians for scheduled work orders.
  - **Supervisory Agent** – The controller agent that handles routing and task synthesis across all agents.
